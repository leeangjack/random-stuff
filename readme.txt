I used datatables plugin to display the json file I obtained from sf.data.gov.
The datatable plugin allows users to choose which columns they want to view by selecting from the shown columns button.
Pagination of results is also supported. 
I then used yadcf plugin to add column filters with autocomplete to filter the data in each column.
The movie title on the first column is clicable. Once clicked, the results will be displayed on the map canvas below the table.
